# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Guidelines

1. **Make A Branch**. Please create a separate branch for each issue that you're working on. Do not make changes to the default branch. Make sure you fork the repo to your Github first.
2. **Only touch relevant files**. Make sure your PR stays focused on a single feature. Don’t change project configs or any files unrelated to the subject you’re working. Open a single PR for each subject.
3. **Make sure your code is clean**. Checkout the project style guide, make sure your code is conformant and clean. Remove any debugging lines (debuggers, console.log).
4. **Make sure tests pass**. All our projects’ unit tests can be run by typing npm test at the root of the project.
5. **Keep your commit history short and clean**. Keeping the history clean means making one commit per feature. It also means squashing every fix you make on your branch after team review. Use [Conventional Git Commit Messages ](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
